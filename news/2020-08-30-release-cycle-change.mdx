Since launching in 2018, Amorphic received updates approximately every four weeks. As of version 1.6, we’re moving from approximate monthly releases to a Quarterly Release Cycle to align with Cloudwick’s global strategy for Amorphic application releases. This means you can expect a new version once every quarter.

<!-- truncate -->
The Quarterly Release Cycle means that you will be on a consistent version of Amorphic for more time. This extra time can be used to develop use-cases, train users, and deploy content within a consistent version of the solution.

Quarterly updates are usually planned for January, April, July, and October of each year. All customer subscriptions will move to quarterly release from August 2020.

We will continue to provide **beta features** and **hot fixes** for selected customers.
